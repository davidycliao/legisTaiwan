## Fetching Caucus Meeting Data

First, load the package:

```{r}
library(legisTaiwan)
```

Now, let's retrieve caucus meeting records. Note the special date format required:


```{r}
caucus_df <- get_caucus_meetings(
    start_date = "111/09/23", 
    end_date = "112/01/19", 
    verbose = FALSE
)
```

Important notes about date formatting:

- Dates must be in ROC calendar format
- Format required: "YYY/MM/DD" (with slashes)
- This differs from the format used in get_bills()
- Format standardization is planned for version 0.2+

View the retrieved data:

```{r}
caucus_df$data
```

The returned data includes comprehensive information about caucus meetings, such as:

- Meeting dates and times
- Participating party caucuses
- Meeting agendas and topics
- Attendance records
- Meeting outcomes and decisions

The `docUrl` field provides direct access to the original caucus meeting minutes and documentation. This URL links to the official Legislative Yuan's repository where researchers and the public can view detailed records of caucus deliberations.

```{r}
caucus_df$data[c("subject", "docUrl")]
```
