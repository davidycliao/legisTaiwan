<div style="text-align: justify">

**`legisTaiwan`** is an R package for accessing [Taiwan Legislative Yuan API](https://data.ly.gov.tw/index.action). The goal of `legisTaiwan` is to make it quickly and instantly download Taiwan's legislative data, digitized textual 
and video records for a research project and analyze public policies.

remotes::install_github("davidycliao/legisTaiwan", force = TRUE)
