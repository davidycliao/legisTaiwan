## Get Started with Using [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes):

<div style="text-align: justify">

**`legisTaiwan`** is an R package for accessing [Taiwan Legislative Yuan API](https://data.ly.gov.tw/index.action). The goal of `legisTaiwan` is to make it quickly and instantly download Taiwan's legislative data, digitized textual 
and video records for a research project and analyze public policies. Its initial development was part of David Yen-Chieh Liao' Dissertation project **[Electoral Reform, Distributive Politics, and Parties in the Taiwanese Congress](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/phd-thesis/main/Yen_Chieh_Liao_PhD_Dissertation_Jan_2023.pdf)** supported by 2021 Taiwanese Overseas Pioneers Grant (TOP GRANT), the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of Taiwan. The package is, therefore, of great benefit to researchers, students, and policy analysts interested in Taiwan legislative politics (and Taiwan politics in general) with fewer financial resources. In addition, the annotation of digitized text and labelled records of video contents may interest researchers and students who want to build an algorithm for computational research in social science and make Taiwan's democracy more transparent and accountable.
